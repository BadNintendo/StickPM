			<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to StickPM, a real-time platform for creating chatrooms, streaming video, and managing profiles. StickPM provides customizable rooms through virtual credits and VIP services. By using our platform, you agree to the terms outlined here. Please read them carefully.
			</p>
	
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Room Creation and Virtual Credits</strong>
					<p>
						Members can create up to 3 rooms per account. Each room can be upgraded using non-refundable virtual credits, which may enable VIP status, enhanced stream capacity, and other features. VIP rooms support up to 24 streams with improved quality.
					</p>
					<p>
						Credits can only be withdrawn once a threshold of 100-500 credits is reached. Withdrawals are currently disabled during development. Credits are non-refundable and for in-platform use only.
					</p>
				</li>
	
				<li>
					<strong>Credit Expiration and Transfer</strong>
					<p>
						If a room's credit balance remains unused for over 365 days, a portion may be transferred to the room owner's account. StickPM reserves the right to adjust expiration periods and related policies at any time.
					</p>
				</li>
	
				<li>
					<strong>Room Management and Accountability</strong>
					<p>
						Room owners are responsible for managing their rooms and ensuring that user activities comply with StickPM's guidelines. Moderators can be assigned roles to assist in maintaining order. All streams and chat activities are the responsibility of the room owner and moderators.
					</p>
					<p>
						Failure to address misconduct, such as harassment or abuse, may result in room suspension or loss of privileges.
					</p>
				</li>
	
				<li>
					<strong>Non-Refundable Virtual Credits</strong>
					<p>
						All purchases and transfers of virtual credits are final and cannot be refunded. StickPM reserves the right to modify virtual credit policies, but refunds for unused credits will not be issued under any circumstances.
					</p>
				</li>
	
				<li>
					<strong>Amendments to Terms</strong>
					<p>
						StickPM may modify these terms without prior notice. Continued use of StickPM after updates will constitute your acceptance of the revised terms. Users are encouraged to review the terms regularly.
